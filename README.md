# 🛡️ Canon Boundary Guard for GPT Projects

Canon Boundary Guard for GPT Projects is a source-bundle frame for ChatGPT.

It helps ChatGPT keep project files, chat context, project instructions,
operator instructions, working assumptions, and generated drafts separated
during long or complex sessions.

It is not a native ChatGPT skill. It works by combining Project Instructions
with a zipped folder added to the Project files. You can also use it manually in
a normal chat by uploading the bundle and asking ChatGPT to inspect it, but a
Project gives the frame a more stable place to live.

## 🔎 What It Does

In a long session, many things can start looking equally important:

- files already attached to the Project
- things said in the current chat
- older project memory or moved chats
- instructions that tell ChatGPT how to behave
- assumptions made by the model
- drafts generated during the session

Canon Boundary Guard gives ChatGPT a frame for keeping those layers separate
before something becomes reusable material.

The main goal is simple: a chat message, draft, assumption, or generated file
should not silently become canon.

## 📦 Install

Recommended Project setup:

1. Create a zip from this folder:

```text
canon-boundary-guard-gpt/
```

2. Add that zip to your ChatGPT Project files or sources.

3. Copy the contents of:

```text
PROJECT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
```

4. Paste them into the Project instructions.

5. Start a new chat inside the Project.

The zip contains the frame. The Project instructions tell ChatGPT to open it,
inspect it, and use it as the operating frame for the session.

Manual chat setup:

1. Upload the same zip in a normal ChatGPT conversation.
2. Ask ChatGPT to inspect the bundle and use it as the active frame for the
   session.

Manual use is less stable than a Project because the instruction anchor is only
inside the conversation.

## ▶️ Use

Use the Project or chat normally.

When the frame is active, ChatGPT should inspect the bundle before substantive
work and separate:

- inspected evidence
- chat material
- operator-approved changes
- agent-control instructions
- model assumptions

For ordinary conversation, it should stay quiet.

It should surface when something starts crossing a boundary: a hypothesis starts
acting like a premise, a draft starts acting like a decision, or a saved answer,
reusable document, Project Source, Canvas/document output, state file, recovery
material, or promoted artifact starts becoming saved or reusable material.

## ⚠️ Limits

This package cannot block every answer, save, file action, or UI action. It
only defines what should be recognized as canon.

A Project is the recommended container. A normal chat can use the bundle too,
but continuity is weaker.

The frame reduces silent promotion. It is not a guarantee.

## 🤖 AI-assisted development

This project was developed with AI assistance.

The project, documentation, and repository materials were shaped through
human-directed work supported by AI tools during drafting, structuring, review,
and refinement.

AI assistance does not make the project automatically correct, complete, or
suitable for every use case. Read it, test it, and adapt it to your own context.

## 🧭 Operating Model

This is a GPT Project adaptation of Canon Boundary Guard. It can also be used as
a manually uploaded session frame in ordinary ChatGPT chats, with weaker
continuity.

It does not rely on Codex hooks, Claude skill execution, browser extensions, or
a background service.

The recommended operating model is:

- upload the zipped source bundle to the Project
- paste `PROJECT_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS.txt` into Project instructions
- require ChatGPT to locate and inspect the bundle before substantive work
- use the bundle as the active provenance-control frame
- treat Project files, `/mnt/data`, and saved material as evidence only after
  current-task inspection

## 🧩 Source Classes

The frame separates source classes:

- `L0`: inspected evidence
- `L1`: chat material and project memory, not canon
- `L1A`: operator-approved delta in the current turn
- `L2`: agent-control instructions
- `L3`: unverified model prior

A Project Source is `L0` only for the relevant surface inspected in the current
task. Presence in Project files is not evidence by itself.

## 🚦 Simulated Gate

GPT Projects do not expose a user-defined pre-write hook.

The adapter therefore defines a simulated gate at the semantic persistence
boundary.

The gate is required before:

- downloadable final artifacts
- Canvas or document output intended for reuse
- Project Source candidates
- reusable specs, workflows, naming rules, protocols, or policies
- state or recovery operations
- promotion from scratch to canon/final output
- any output marked `[SAFE TO SAVE]`

Labels are deterministic:

```text
[SAFE TO SAVE]
[DO NOT SAVE - L1/L3 PRESENT]
[STATE DELTA - SAVE/PASTE ONLY AS RECOVERY MATERIAL]
[DRAFT - REQUIRES OPERATOR APPROVAL]
```

## 📦 Source-Staged Extraction

If the bundle zip is available only inside `/mnt/data`, it can be extracted as a
source-staged extraction.

That extracted copy may support `L0` inspection only as a mechanical view of the
uploaded or Project Source zip it came from.

Before treating extracted files as `L0`, the assistant should record the source
zip path or source id, and hash if available. If no anchor is available, it must
declare the missing anchor and limit `L0` to the inspected path with a risk note.

Assistant-generated scratch artifacts remain non-evidence.

## 🧠 State and Recovery

Working state path:

```text
/mnt/data/_SESSION_STATE.json
```

This file is not durable by itself.

First-install state may be created only when the operator declares a fresh
install, or when the task is initial bundle installation and there is no
prior-state claim.

The first-install state must record the inspected bootstrap surfaces in
`active_l0_sources`. A schema-minimal state with an empty `active_l0_sources`
array is not a first-install template.

Outside first install, if valid state is unavailable, the adapter enters
read-only recovery mode.

Recovery sources:

1. uploaded `SESSION_STATE.json`
2. pasted `CANON_STATE_DELTA` with valid `current_state`
3. explicit operator reconstruction marked as `L1A`

## 🧪 Validators

The Python scripts are optional mechanical helpers. They are not hooks and do
not decide provenance.

`validate_state.py` validates `SESSION_STATE` and `CANON_STATE_DELTA` files:

- uses `jsonschema` when available
- falls back to strict manual validation
- reads JSON with `utf-8-sig`
- fails closed when a required schema feature cannot be checked

`extract_proof.py` extracts mechanical proof-of-read from text or Markdown
files and reads with `utf-8-sig`.

`artifact_fingerprint.py` emits file size, modified time, and SHA-256.

## ⚠️ Limits

This package reduces silent promotion. It does not provide hard enforcement.

ChatGPT can still answer incorrectly, skip instructions, lose context, or fail
to inspect available files. The frame is a working discipline for GPT Projects,
not a guarantee.
